<h3><br>Learning How To Play Keyboard<br><br>
I have always been interested in art since I was young so it did not take me too much time to decide the general area for my project. Drawing, Singing or Dancing have been growing with me since I was little. However, to make this project more challenging and interesting, I will try to do something I have never done before. At the end, I come up with the idea why donâ€™t I try to learn how to play Keyboard. Keyboard is a pretty popular instrument that lots of people play so I think that this is a good chance for me to start learning something new.</h3><br>
